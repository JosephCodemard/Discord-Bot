## Setup ##

You must first have a bot set up. This can be done throught the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

You must start by going into [config.json](../master/src/config.json) and add your bot's credentials.
The `bot_id` field must be surronded by <@! and >


#### Note ####

The prefix and bot name is completely optional and does not relate to anything.
The `server_general_id` is a reference to the channel id of the channel `general`


```shell
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

This will start the bot.

---

## Syntax ##

The bot can be referenced by the prefix token.
By default it is `!`, or the bot's name @botname

The name of the command is then typed after that, as well as any parameters
(The command is not case sensitive)

#### For example ####


```
!           Add         Hello world
^           ^^^^        ^^^^^^^^^^^
prefix     command       arguments
```

This would make the command 

`! Add Hello world`
